Instructions: 
Bubble Sort of LL (âš¡Interview Question)
Assignment:

Write a bubble_sort() method in the LinkedList class that will sort the elements of a linked list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The method should update the head and tail pointers of the linked list to reflect the new order of the nodes in the list. You can assume that the input linked list will contain only integers. You should not use any additional data structures to sort the linked list.



Input:

The LinkedList object containing a linked list with unsorted elements (self).



Output:

None. The method sorts the linked list in place.



Method Description:

If the length of the linked list is less than 2, the method returns and the list is assumed to be already sorted.

The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly iterating through the unsorted part of the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

The method starts with the entire linked list being the unsorted part of the list.

For each pass through the unsorted part of the list, the method iterates through each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted part of the list will "bubble up" to the end of the list.

The method continues iterating through the unsorted part of the list until no swaps are made during a pass.

After the linked list is fully sorted, the head and tail pointers of the linked list are updated to reflect the new order of the nodes in the list.



Constraints:

The linked list can contain duplicates.

The method should be implemented in the LinkedList class.

The method should not use any additional data structures to sort the linked list.
