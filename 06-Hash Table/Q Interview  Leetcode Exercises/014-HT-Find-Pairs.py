Instructions: 
Set: Find Pairs (âš¡Interview Question)
You are given two lists of integers, arr1 and arr2, and a target integer value, target. Your task is to find all pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum equals target.

Write a function called find_pairs that takes in three arguments: arr1, arr2, and target, and returns a list of all such pairs.

Input

Your function should take in the following inputs:

arr1: a list of integers

arr2: a list of integers

target: an integer


Output

Your function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers from arr1 and arr2 that add up to target.


Example

Here's an example of what your function should return:

arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 7
 
pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
print (pairs)
# Output: [(5, 2), (3, 4), (1, 6)]


In this example, the pairs (5, 2) , (3, 4) , and (1, 6) are the only pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum is 7.

def find_pairs(arr1: list[int], arr2: list[int], target: int) -> list:
    # Convert arr1 to a set for O(1) lookup
    set1 = set(arr1)
    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs
    pairs = []
    # Loop through each number in arr2
    for num in arr2:
        # Calculate the complement of the current number
        complement = target - num
        # Check if the complement is in set1
        if complement in set1:
            # If it is, add the pair to the pairs list
            pairs.append((complement, num))
    # Return the list of pairs that add up to the target value
    return pairs


arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 7

pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
print(pairs)

    EXPECTED OUTPUT:
    ----------------
